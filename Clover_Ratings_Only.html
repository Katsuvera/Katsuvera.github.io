                <div class="chatlog__content">
                    <span class="markdown">Just in case anyone here doesn&#39;t know the story, I was never really intended to be the leader at the start. I just ended up taking the initiative near the beginning to create the spreadsheets and ended up getting close to Roxy via talking in DMs. Then one day in the middle of like... I don&#39;t know which CB it was lol let&#39;s say May or something, Roxy did a bad hit or maybe he forgot to hit? I can&#39;t remember which but he was upset that he messed up a hit or two and he got really stressed, thought he wasn&#39;t fit for leader and he gave me the leader role in-game. So I just woke up one morning and I was lead. <img class="emoji " alt="sweat1" title="sweat1" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/625199320483889163.png" /> 
Though tbh I didn&#39;t do very much with the &#39;leader&#39; role for the first two months, I recall Rasp and Silence and Mille doing a lot of the work until I finally, like, started doing leadership stuff. :v

Anyway, the point of this message was two things:

A.) I didn&#39;t have any real &#39;leadership&#39; experience before this so I used these last two years largely as a learning experience tbh. And, well, while there were some stressful times (largely recruitment and occasionally having to kick ppl), I do feel like I learned a lot. I&#39;m grateful to Roxy for <s>thrusting upon me</s> giving me this experience. I&#39;ll be honest, I can&#39;t help but think that maybe Clover could&#39;ve done better or lasted longer if someone with more actual leadership skills were in charge the last two years but... well, that&#39;s just my usual anxiety, not like the past can be changed, ya know... which leads into my second point

B.) I&#39;m sorry if the clan didn&#39;t turn out as much like a &quot;family&quot; as people wanted or if my lack of understanding how to be &quot;casual&quot; made things unnecessarily stressful but... I hope that I was able to make Clover into a place that y&#39;all enjoyed, at least a little bit.</span>

I don&#39;t remember the who the JP names were tbh so I&#39;m skipping over them.

Falle... hmmmm... Let&#39;s give him a 7/10. tbh I have friends in another server that knew him from GBF before he start PriConne and they didn&#39;t really like him. <img class="emoji " alt="hatsunexd" title="hatsunexd" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/641858056543666207.png" /> He was apparently the luckiest luccsack and would always post his roles in the &#39;gacha&#39; channel and talk about how &#39;good his luck was&#39;. I didn&#39;t know all that at the start (of priconne) to clarify, I was just told about it later when somehow his name was brought up. Anyway, I don&#39;t recall him being like that in Clover at least (though maybe that&#39;s cuz I always had the gacha channel muted) so I don&#39;t think he&#39;s that bad. Well it was a while ago so I don&#39;t really remember... Uhm... Well, he was in the clan for a while at least and there were no real issues that I recall. Oh actually last year on April 1st, I changed a lot of ppls names for april fools joke and I changed his Discord nickname from &quot;Not Falle&quot; (what he always went by) to &quot;Actually Falle&quot;. I dunno if he actually never noticed or if he was too lazy to change but he never changed it. It&#39;s still Actually Falle lol</span>

I do recall him worrying about having a &#39;weak roster&#39; at the start and... well, looking at the results he was Rank 29 in april. :3 I&#39;m glad he didn&#39;t lose motivation though and his hard work helped him steadily improve. He went from 29 to 25 (may) to pulling his own weight at 18 in july. <img class="emoji " alt="daishouri" title="daishouri" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/586322872780455955.png" /> And he&#39;s been a consistently well-performing member since then. I basically gave up on / stopped playing GBF when I started PriConne so I&#39;m impressed he was able to grind GBF while doing PriConne, too.</span>

He did all the calculations for &quot;adjusted damage&quot; you can see in the spreadsheets from may (next month) and onward. I give him a 9/10, too, since he was a mod and did his fair share of work. But... is there anything interesting to say about him... hmmmm... man I feel bad but I don&#39;t remember much. We didn&#39;t really talk in DMs tbh so we weren&#39;t that &quot;close&quot;. The only thing I distinctly remember is when I pointed out the weird way he used one word and I didn&#39;t go about it very well and it turned into a bit of a confrontation. I don&#39;t think he liked me all that much after that. <img class="emoji " alt="FeelsBadMan" title="FeelsBadMan" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/625199319334518795.png" /></span>

                    <span class="markdown">And as for Leo... A tough one. 7/10? He might&#39;ve had a lot of issues with me/Clover but tbh I didn&#39;t really have any issues with him. He would leave his attacks til the end of the day most of the time and while he wasn&#39;t Saiki-level flexible, he wasn&#39;t Kasumi-level unprepared either so it wasn&#39;t a bad thing. As for<em>why</em> he left his attacks until then and then complained about losing sleep... The world may never know. He ended up being the brunt of some jokes (like that time I created that &quot;main lobby but without leo&quot; channel... that one went over a lot better in my head than it did IRL) and he was picked on by Knyaz a lot... To be frank even though here it&#39;ll seem like I&#39;m talking behind is back, he was A.) the most outgoing/talkative in main lobby and B.) imo he was pretty sensitive. It made for a sorta volatile combination... I recall having to talk with him in DMs various times over the past two years and convince him to stay in the clan - not because he wasn&#39;t enjoying it like at the end but because he messed up attacks IIRC and he felt bad and like he wasn&#39;t pulling his weight so he&#39;d tell me he wanted to leave. I had to tell him he was still doing perfectly fine and pulling his weight, etc. So he clearly took CB pretty seriously... tbh I&#39;ll always regret the way he left. I should&#39;a said something sooner after Troupe put out that message. feelsbadman after being here for two years. but such is life. at least he got over it a little bit and started talking to melvi again.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">I&#39;ll give Shino an 8.5/10. Though typing that, now I wonder if I&#39;m saving 9s for ppl that have been mods. Is there a reason to not give him 9? hmmmm... not sure but thinking about these ratings too much is gonna make this take forever. &quot;Shino has always been a consistently well performing member&quot; is what I&#39;d say off the top of my head. Never had issues with him. IIRC he was one of the few people initially who offered to help keep the spreadsheet updated. The only &#39;interesting&#39; thing I remember from the days of yore is when Clover got sorta high in rankings and one of the youtubers mentioned us in a stream and someone named &quot;(name redacted) Shinobu&quot; commented in the stream about how Clover was rushing at the end of the day and then I got a DM asking &quot;who is this person and how do they know we were rushing, are they a spy&quot; and then we narrowed it down to Shino cuz of (name redacted) was in the e-mail he had to send me to get access to edit the spreadsheet, and for a very brief amount of time, I couldn&#39;t help but worry that he was a JP spy, despite the fact that he&#39;d been in the clan for a while at that point LOL also I thought it was cute that his name was <em>Shino</em>-bu. That&#39;s... all I can really think of to say... Well, there&#39;s the usual respect I have for people that can translate JP for me. I appreciate the help he&#39;s given me in the past in that regard and am glad he&#39;s around. <img class="emoji " alt="animeNodYes" title="animeNodYes" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/427991826872401933.gif" /></span>

                    <span class="markdown">Hibiki aka. Hibaka aka. Hibki for a few days a little while ago when he forgot one of the i&#39;s in his name in the announcements is fairly cheerful fellow, only being prone to anger once or twice over the past two years that I&#39;ve known him. Actually, I&#39;m not sure that last part is entirely true, IIRC he joined the clan, left again for a bit and then re-applied later so can I really say that I &#39;knew him&#39; for those months he wasn&#39;t here? Should I say &#39;for most of the two years that I&#39;ve known him&#39;? A conundrum indeed. Regardless, Hibiki is a very talented video editor, a skill set that he employed to make the current server icon which I am very grateful for because I think it&#39;s amazing. I believe he is also to be respected for not changing his discord avatar at all over the past two years. Such dedication to one singular waifu is impressive. I regret that I do not see much Hibiki fan art to send him more often. He once told me I should add parsley to my food so I went and bought way too much at the store and couldn&#39;t use it all in time and it went bad. I haven&#39;t bought any parsley since. Oh, he does alright in CB, too. 9/10</span>

                    <span class="markdown">but in all seriousness, Hibiki has always been a hard working member and along with troupe and eri, was one of the members that was &#39;basically doing mod work already and I just gave them the tag to make it official&#39; (and to give them access to being able to edit things around the server). Particularly Hibiki helped give me lots of advice last year and was great to talk to about things that were stressing me out. I&#39;m very grateful to have him around in Clover for so long. And that&#39;s not even talking about the work he&#39;s done as a mod, I&#39;ll always be grateful to Troupe, Eri and him for helping alleviate some of the work during CB. And Hibiki&#39;s timeline format is another boon. I didn&#39;t even know the &quot;css&quot; stuff was a thing before, when he started using it I thought &quot;what is this magic&quot;</span>

Dennis: 5/10. 
Cryst: 6/10

I was initially pondering a 4 for Dennis but he <em>was</em> in the clan (Cryst, too) for quite a while so... I upped it to 5. They were good and hardworking in the beginning but slowly lost motivation and their performance became worse and worse... tbh for a while, I had them both mentally in the category of &quot;would replace if we ever had an excess of applicants&quot; (we never did). I can&#39;t really remember around what time of day Dennis hit but IIRC Cryst was always at the end of the day. I don&#39;t recall either of them doing any testing of their own... Maybe Cryst at the beginning. And, well, Dennis is rated lower for the obvious reason of never reading chat and often coming in and asking questions about stuff that was literally discussed just one or two scrolls up. <img class="emoji " alt="vampyHeh" title="vampyHeh" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/625199320496472084.png" /></span>

(I used to do a fair amount of them, around every other month, asking members how their motivation was, how they felt last CB went, etc) I recall having to try to simplify the questions to be as straight forward as possible for him haha as for CB performance... tbh as much as I remember, he was always hovering around the &quot;average rank 100 cutoff&quot; and in the end I&#39;m pretty sure I kicked him for poor performance... Mmmmmm, I think he was one of the ones I kicked when pine and co. joined? It was after he&#39;d been in the clan for a while, in any case, and I felt pretty bad about it.

Basically in the same category as Shino: &quot;I&#39;m not sure why I&#39;m not giving them 9 other than because I&#39;m keeping that for mods for no reason&quot;. That makes Natz the third member to still be in the clan (from when he joined). [The first two being Kotori and Shino and I&#39;m not counting Rasp and Hibiki because they left for a few months in the middle.] Well, there&#39;s the usual things to say like he&#39;s always been a good member - hard-working, consistent, dependable. Never had any issues, ya know. But, how to say this... We haven&#39;t talked much in DMs (outside of my questionnaires) so I don&#39;t really know much about him and I can&#39;t remember any situations, good or bad, that stand out... Yeah, I sat here thinking for a while and I can&#39;t come up with anything interesting to say. Sorry Natz. <img class="emoji " alt="PepeHands" title="PepeHands" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/590415904366526464.png" /> Well, like I said, he&#39;s always performed well and was a great member to have around. Thanks for your hard work over the past almost-two-years, Natz~

(I realized while typing that last part, I should try and save some compliments, there&#39;s still a lot of ppl to go, I&#39;m gonna run out of original things that sound sincere at this rate! <img class="emoji " alt="AWAAAA" title="AWAAAA" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/586383552992509952.png" /> )</span>

We talked a bit in DMs about random stuff. I recall him being hard-working, testing teams for himself, pulling his own weight and whatnot. He was in the clan for a decent amount of time, over half a year, IIRC? And I don&#39;t recall having any real issues. He created his own PvP server that grew pretty big. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s used that much anymore but at the time he / it was at the forefront of PvP organization. The server was created before the PvP database website was, right? Pretty sure it had to be. <img class="emoji " alt="worrythink" title="worrythink" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/592030765022445584.png" /></span>

                    <span class="markdown">Test: 4/10. Actually this rating is really arbitrary because I barely remember anything about him. The only reason I didn&#39;t put him in the other category (the &quot;I don&#39;t remember anything about&quot; category) is so I could mention <em>the moment</em>. IIRC Test was Thai as well (we got a fair amount of Thai recruits at the time when Rasp helped recruit) and his English wasn&#39;t that good. Though, again, like Thnk, I don&#39;t think it really affected his ability to communicate with us during CB so I&#39;m not mentioning it cuz it&#39;s a bad thing, I&#39;m just mentioning it because... I&#39;m not sure what else to say haha now as for <em>the moment</em>...

As you can see from the screenshot below, this was a month where A.) there was no overflow yet and B.) average attacks were getting upwards of 1mil damage. B5 was left &quot;at low health&quot; around 225k which should&#39;ve been easy for anyone to kill and Test volunteered to kill the boss. IIRC since it was his first attack of the day, he wanted to use &#39;shitty characters&#39; that he knew he wouldn&#39;t need in either of his other attacks, to keep himself flexible. And let me tell you, that backfired. Horribly. I can&#39;t remember the other 4 but I do know that he used Ilya and she crit herself and died at the start. And the other 4 were so bad that they couldn&#39;t do any real damage (Ilya was the &#39;carry&#39; he was relying on). And so basicaly he wasn&#39;t able to kill the boss and we had to use a second attack to kill it. It was <em>really</em> unfortunate. At least a few people sent him pings with question marks when it happened, tbh I was probably one of them... <img class="emoji " alt="MonkaS" title="MonkaS" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/625199320064589824.png" /> 

Honestly though, he handled it really well, I recall him coming online later and apologizing profusely to everyone for it (also explaining at the time that ilya crit herself, which is how we know about that) and he still did all his attacks as usual after that so looking back on it, it&#39;s really funny.</span>

Hello Ntogg. I&#39;m sorry to inform you that, presumably by the time you wake up and see this, you will have been removed from the Clan.

Oh, no, the reminding about attacks wasn&#39;t part of the reason. I will admit that I don&#39;t recall getting pinged by Azazel on... what was it, Day 10? And on that day, it was only you that had sent me a reminder. So I&#39;m willing to operate under the assumption that you took up the role of Attack Reminder because Azazel was slacking. And even if both of you were doing it, I don&#39;t think extra pings for not-attacking-yet would be worth kicking for. No, the primary reason for your departure from the Clan was because Rasp really, really did not like you. So much so, that he wanted you gone. Now, yes, I will admit that wanting someone kicked just because you don&#39;t or can&#39;t get along with them could be considered... Petty? Silly? Childish, perhaps? However, it wasn&#39;t just Rasp. I think it would be accurate to say that Silence was just not a fan of you. That is to say, I think the only direct interaction he had with you was when you scoffed at him for &quot;not clearing EX dungeon yet?&quot; I myself, while definitely grateful for the work that you did to keep the spreadsheet updated, must say that you&#39;re lack of manners and tact rubbed me the wrong way from the beginning. Combine these with the fact that when the matter of removing you was brought up in the assessment channel, no one had anything to say in your defense <em>along with</em> your proclivity for attacking Bosses 1 or 2 (which to clarify wouldn&#39;t <em>really</em> be an issue just by itself but when combined with the rest didn&#39;t help your case) and the decision was made.</span>

 - he &quot;score-whore&#39;d&quot; by hitting B1/2 mainly

he&#39;s actually the only person in the history of Clover that I would ever accuse of scorewhoring. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ever been a problem outside of him.</span>

Always worked hard and tried his best in CB. Hmmm, man, it&#39;s already getting hard to think of original compliments... He was just a solid member, good to have around. There was just the one incident the month before he left where he sorta, like, rage quit for a day? And then unfortunately despite coming back, apologizing and hitting normally the rest of that CB, he ended up leaving with Fumios after that. <s>He told me that he liked Clover overall but he really didn&#39;t like Rasp or Eri more so he had to leave. though don&#39;t tell anyone I said that kappa</s> this has me thinking that I should go and message him and see what he&#39;s up to these days. <img class="emoji " alt="retardedDino" title="retardedDino" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/625199319225729034.png" /></span>

Mille was the first &quot;bot guy&quot; in the clan, before Jon joined. I respect him very much since I don&#39;t know know anything about bots and am impressed with what he&#39;s been able to make. Especially the attack-recording bot is amazing since, like, the others I can see him being humble about it and saying he just copied Nadeko but that one is pretty unique (or seems that way to me). Mille is the only one left with the role from the &quot;old&quot; group of mods and he still does work around the server even after leaving the clan a while ago, I&#39;m very grateful to him for the all the work he&#39;s done. <img class="emoji " alt="rooAwwShake" title="rooAwwShake" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/433877729587232780.gif" /></span>

                    <span class="markdown">I&#39;ll start with Eri since he left first. I give him a 9/10. I was mulling over whether to give him higher or lower and initially thought he should be a bit lower because of, uh, well, the circumstances that lead to him leaving but then thought that wouldn&#39;t be fair since he was still incredibly helpful as a mod. So 9 it is.

Eri was... Blunt? Straight-forward, I guess? Even more than Rasp, I&#39;d say, he wasn&#39;t afraid to point out when people made mistakes. In the same way as Rasp, when people made mistakes, Eri basically said the things I was thinking but wasn&#39;t sure if I should say outright. I always appreciated them for that since A.) I think that pointing out mistakes is a necessity in order to improve and B.) I think it worked out well in my favor because I felt they played the &#39;bad guy&#39; in pointing it out and I was able to play the &#39;good guy&#39; by saying stuff like &quot;well it was unfortunate but the important part is you learn from it&quot; etc etc. <img class="emoji " alt="kappaLUL" title="kappaLUL" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/665053341104996392.png" /> 

Eri was always an incredibly hard worker, like Hibiki and Troupe, really, since the same can be said for the three of them. As I mentioned with Hibiki, Eri was basically doing mod work before I gave him the role. I&#39;ll always be grateful to him for taking over the &quot;end of day organizing&quot; which helped alleviate <em>a lot</em> of my CB stress. It&#39;s unfortunate that, from what I know anyway, it was relatively directly linked to his reason for leaving. <img class="emoji " alt="FeelsBadMan" title="FeelsBadMan" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/625199319334518795.png" /> (I&#39;ll get into why in a second but I&#39;m reaching the message limit.)</span>

                    <span class="markdown">IIRC it was the end of Sept. &#39;19 GW, literally the end of the last day and Eri was organizing the hits we had left. (I had stayed up real late the night before so ended up sleeping straight through the end of the day. Thankfully I was done my hits.) Eri had most attacks organized but with one issue - he was waiting on Hibiki to show up with his last attack and since there was <em>very</em> little flexibility that CB in terms of teams, Hibiki was the only person with the characters available to hit the boss they were stuck on.

And I think the easiest TL;DR here is that Hibiki didn&#39;t end up showing up (he had also stayed up late with me) so in the end Eri had to get some members to throw &#39;whatever they had left&#39; to get things moving which not only felt pretty bad for the members involved but also meant he had to change his plans around at the last minute to not include the members that just threw shit, of course.

(To clarify: I don&#39;t really remember this part but apparently that month we ended up Rank 11 or so and Eri says the points we lost then were the difference between Rank 9.) Anyway, at the end of the day, Eri was feeling pretty depressed about the results and the chain of events that had occurred but what ended up actually making him angry was two comments in particular:
Jon saying &quot;were not gonna be sss? sad emoji&quot;
and Kasumi saying something like &#39;why did we wait so long to do things, we should have moved earlier&#39;

And I guess the TL;DR from there is that he felt those comments were unfair, he&#39;d tried his best but in the end he didn&#39;t get recognition, only ridicule, and he realized that CB just wasn&#39;t fun anymore. (A bit more complicated than that but I think it&#39;s a decent TL;DR).

Now that was part 2 to the eri trilogy, excuse me while I start part 3 in another message because I&#39;m getting close the text limit again.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">And the end of the trilogy: 

Now, all that information that I just typed in Part 2, I did not know any of that for <em>months</em>. Like I said at the start, I slept through the end of that day. I woke up and everything had pretty much calmed down (and to be frank I was too lazy to scroll up through hundreds of backlog messages) so I was under the impression that we did pretty well (to get Rank 11). I was completely unaware of everything that had happened. Well fast forward a few days and Eri makes a comment in our mod chat about how he&#39;s making plans to leave the clan. When I saw this message A.) I had just woken up and was groggy and B.) I was so surprised by it that I didn&#39;t know how to respond. I ended up responding with

well that&#39;s pretty rip
you don&#39;t wanna pull a Rasp and stay but without the mod role/responsibilities, eh?

this was still near the beginning of the month, shortly after CB, to clarify. And Eri didn&#39;t respond to that. So then I was left with two choices: I DM Eri and ask him directly what was wrong / if he was leaving OR I wait for him to say something more about it, ie. I was worried that pushing the subject might make things worse. In the end, in typical lazy Katsu fashion, I chose the easiest option of &quot;not doing anything&quot; and didn&#39;t DM him about it, waiting to see if he&#39;d bring it up.

WELL it turns out that basically the rest of that month, he was <em>waiting</em> for me / someone to message him about it so he could talk about it. So me choosing to not DM him was absolutely the wrong choice... And then, as Eri told me later when we finally talked, during that month while he was waiting for me to message, &quot;his feelings of anger and sadness turned to apathy and he stopped caring about CB and lost motivation&quot;. <img class="emoji " alt="animeWhenLifeGetsAtYou" title="animeWhenLifeGetsAtYou" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/428006506034626591.png" /> 

And that&#39;s when I realized Eri was a big tsundere who said he was upset but was actually &quot;waiting for me to message him to convince him to stay&quot; &lt;-- his words <img class="emoji " alt="animePeek2" title="animePeek2" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/427997921179598849.png" /></span>

Eri was great for ranting to, discussing things with and bouncing ideas off of. Even more than Hibiki, to be honest. Stuff like his straight forward answers would help me organize my thoughts. A few times we talked for hours about the future of the clan and what should be done about casual VS hardcore. I really can&#39;t thank him enough for that alone.</span>

I&#39;m not entirely too sure what to put here that I haven&#39;t already said about the other two. There&#39;s the usual line of &quot;I can&#39;t thank him enough for&quot; and in this case it&#39;s taking over as leader and keeping the clan alive when I took my two month break before. Keeping Eri&#39;s damage baselines alive was also incredibly helpful. Oh and recruitment. I&#39;m pretty sure that if I have grey hairs, it&#39;s from recruitment, and him taking over that was a lifesaver. Although I think he could&#39;ve gone about that message to Aru and Leo a little differently, he&#39;s still a good guy that just wants what&#39;s best for the clan and I don&#39;t blame him considering how hard Aru was slamming him for no reason that CB (and past CBs, IIRC). And I thought of something else to say while typing that last part but forgot it cuz I was distracted by this MYTH &amp; ROID song...</span>

                    <span class="markdown">I&#39;ll do Mizore and his bros first. I&#39;m just gonna lump them all together for obvious reasons (since when his bros finally did join the server, they didn&#39;t really talk and were only on the server to Queue for bosses). I give them all 8.5/10. I think it&#39;s pretty impressive that all 4 of them were consistently well performing every month (from what I recall anyway), with his bros often hitting while at work. I remember being worried at first because the three bros didn&#39;t join the server (they didn&#39;t use discord) and Mizore had to talk for all of them (telling us what bosses they wanted to hit, when they wanted to hit, etc) but thankfully there were never any issues, as far as I recall. As expected of someone that essentially managed 4 people, Mizore was a very hard worker and always gave his all during CB, often staying up very late. I recall thinking that he&#39;d be a good mod candidate. tbh I don&#39;t really recall anything particularly interesting to talk about... He&#39;s another person that we haven&#39;t talked since he left, I should message him and see how he&#39;s doing. <img class="emoji " alt="pecoWant" title="pecoWant" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/625199320647598100.png" /></span>

                    <span class="markdown">Yunarin aka Yuna I&#39;ll give a 7.5/10. Hmmmm... Another case of &quot;I feel bad but I can&#39;t remember too much about them&quot;. Actually, until I read this spreadsheet, I&#39;d totally forgotten about Yuna... <img class="emoji " alt="FeelsBadMan" title="FeelsBadMan" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/625199319334518795.png" /> Trying to think back now, what pops into my head is... Ah, right, Yuna was another member I kicked to make room for pine and co, though I did it very reluctantly. I&#39;d had a &quot;list of potential members to kick&quot; and Yuna was at the very bottom and only got chosen because they told me &quot;if you need to kick me, it&#39;s fine, I understand&quot; whereas other members on the list were more like &quot;I&#39;d like to stay and try harder&quot; sorta thing so I ended up taking the easy route and kicking Yuna. <img class="emoji " alt="PepeHands" title="PepeHands" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/590415904366526464.png" /> I recall Yuna saying the whole &quot;it&#39;s fine if you kick me thing&quot; because he didn&#39;t think he was that good at CB. I only recall one example but it was something like Mizore was able to do, let&#39;s arbitrarily say, 3mil to B5 whereas Yunarin with the same team was only able to do 2.3mil. This was back before we had comprehensive timelines, to clarify. Anyway, that&#39;s what Yunarin said about himself but my impression of him was that he was always pretty average - like around the middle of the rankings. Not the best but not the worst. His CB performance aside, he was a very nice guy, happy and enjoyable to talk to. I think he was sorta close to <span class="mention" title="Hibiki#2549">@Hibiki Oats</span> so maybe Hibiki has more to say?</span>

When he left, he ended up joining a JP clan and I recall, around that time (when pine and co joined), I was really focusing on ways to improve both my leadership and the clan so after the next CB (after he&#39;d been in the JP clan for a month), I sorta, like, grilled him on how things were done in the JP clan. Then when he mentioned about things they did better, I asked him for more details and like compare how they were to how Clover did it. My memory is a little vague now on how it exactly went down or what I typed but I think I was a little... mmmm, too serious? Perhaps the way I went about it wasn&#39;t very nice cuz he sorta just stopped responding and then we haven&#39;t talked since and I feel bad about that. <img class="emoji " alt="FeelsBadMan" title="FeelsBadMan" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/625199319334518795.png" /></span>

                    <span class="markdown">I&#39;m gonna give Knyaz a 6/10. Honestly, he probably should be a 3 or 4 but he really was a consistently strong member (in terms of CB performance) in the beginning (and for quite a while). I depended on him a lot at the end of the day to be &quot;filler&quot; and hit whatever bosses I needed him to and he&#39;d never complain when I asked him to test, like, X team but then change plans near the end of the day and ask him to test Y and Z teams instead. And his damage was always good, even if he didn&#39;t really have time to test, ya know, that&#39;s why I felt he was dependable. Actually, thinking about it now but I forgot to mention that for Rasp as well - Rasp and Knyaz always made my life easier by being able to flex on any boss at the end of the day (and then Saiki as well, but he came later).

Knyaz&#39;s performance definitely degraded over time, I&#39;m pretty sure it degraded along with his motivation to play, but even at the end when he didn&#39;t really care, I still felt he was a strong member. I think that changed when I left and Troupe took lead though - since before I left for that break, I could justify keeping Knyaz around (despite his shit personality) because of his CB performance but when he started hitting without pausing and screwing over other attacks (I recall this happening when I was on my two month break) then there was no way to &#39;defend&#39; him, I&#39;m pretty sure if Troupe hadn&#39;t kicked him then I would&#39;ve.

                    <span class="markdown">As for his personality... well, it&#39;s well known at this point but I think the easiest way to sum it up is: he was very stereotypically both Russian and an internet troll. I recall when asking him in DMs why he posts NSFW shit in main lobby, one of his responses was &quot;he just wants to fuck with little bitches and see their reactions&quot;. Actually, up until the &quot;NSFW in main lobby&quot; shit, he was just sorta an asshole and it was annoying but (beyond Leo) it didn&#39;t really affect anyone, ya know. But once he started the NSFW shit... then it became a real issue. That was another scenario where I took the &#39;easy route&#39; and largely tried to ignore it, hoping he would stop if we just said &quot;please don&#39;t do that anymore&quot; because I didn&#39;t want to cause any confrontation - recruitment was already hard enough, I didn&#39;t want to have to fill another spot, ya know. Troupe ended up taking the brunt of that responsibility and confronting him when he kept posting the shit... Sorry about that, Troupe.

Hmmm... Is there anything else to say about him... He actually offered good advice sometimes, though it was also given with a lot of swearing and calling you a fucking dumbass first. Thinking about it, maybe he should be a 5. Maybe 5.5 is better. Oh well.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">Alright so... For those that aren&#39;t aware, when Kasumi joined the clan, the name that he decided upon and asked to be called was &quot;Ricky&quot;. He was called that for quite a while, and it wasn&#39;t until Kasumi&#39;s release in-game that he changed his name. Rather, the way I remember it is that he wanted to be called Kasumi before that but I declined (since I&#39;m a bit of a stickler when it comes to names) and it wasn&#39;t until he sparked Kasumi the day she was released that he convinced me to start calling him Kasumi. But tbh he&#39;ll always be Ricky in my heart. Actually it&#39;s because of this name change that I always read his in-game name&#39;s text ( 霞ヶ丘 詩羽 ) as Ricky and I just assume that&#39;s what it translates to. 

As for his actual rating... Man, what to go with... I&#39;ll be honest, I think that going with the <img class="emoji " alt="💩" title="💩" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f4a9.png" /> emoji is a bit too... easy? Like a low-hanging fruit, ya know. So I&#39;m gonna with

AW0L / 10

Rickysumi is perhaps the weebiest weeb in existence, IIRC he can&#39;t turn when he sleeps or else he&#39;ll roll onto some pins or other various other merch he doesn&#39;t have enough room for. As someone that has never bought a figure before, I&#39;ll admit I can&#39;t help but be a bit impressed at his addiction - I mean, collection.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">I&#39;m fairly confident that Poopsumi has never tested an original team in his life and relies solely on us telling him what teams/characters to use. imo Eri captured his essence perfectly with &quot;[he] shows up at the very last second running around with his head cut off wondering what to do&quot;. At the very least, he is consistent. Consistently AWOL that is - we can depend on him to <strong>not</strong> be around when we need him and show up randomly when we don&#39;t. Yet somehow he manages to still pull things off in the end. The main instance I remember is the month S.Io was used against B5, it was near the end of the day (as usual) and AWOLsumi was testing the S.Io team but could not get it to work (the timing was pretty tight and he always refused to use an auto-clicker which certainly didn&#39;t help. this was also when he made the comment about his &quot;tiny, asian eyes&quot; to clarify). In the end, despite not getting the team to work in any tests, he decided to just yolo the fight and went into real... and somehow it worked. He was able to pull it off. I&#39;ll never know how he managed that tbh.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">In general, when it comes to making calls / decisions during CB, I have a general rule where I make sure to <em>not</em> do whatever Bakasumi suggests or thinks is best. This did not come about as a joke or a meme but rather out of necessity, since most of the time he has no idea what he&#39;s talking about. ...Okay, that&#39;s actually half joke and half true. He really <em>does</em> have a habit of being AWOL, coming back randomly and then trying to help organize attacks but he&#39;s missing a ton of info cuz he wasn&#39;t here for most of what had transpired, ya know, so I did end up ignoring him a lot. There were a few times where he had some decent suggestions. Oh, he&#39;s also really bad at math. I hope someone has told Neko not to let him anywhere near overflow-time calculations. <img class="emoji " alt="kappa" title="kappa" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/625199319678451713.png" /> 

Where Shitsumi <em>does</em> have merit is being a... hmmm, how to word it... he calms down situations really well. Like when Nong had that ragequit or when Aru was bashing on Troupe (and I know there&#39;s other situations but I can&#39;t think of them off the top of my head). I guess the best way to put it is that he has good tact when it comes to diffusing situations with level-headed and non-biased statements/messages and it&#39;s helped me on more than a few occasions, so really, thank you for that, Kasumi.</span>

Well, he&#39;s another member that, like Mizore, I think would&#39;ve been a good fit for the mod position.

He works hard every CB but especially stepped up the last few months (since I took that two month break, IIRC), helping with attack organization at the end of some days. Carrot is probably, hmmm, how to word this... he often leaves his attacks for the end of the day to stay flexible (which I am very grateful for) and is definitely the member with the most &#39;sacrificed&#39; damage during literal last-minute rushes - that is to say, his final score/ranking each CB isn&#39;t very indicative of his actual performance.

Carrot is a very nice fellow, we haven&#39;t casually talked or DM&#39;d that much tbh but he was one of the few members I talked to beforehand and admitted that I needed to quit for my own health. I was nervous about it and I&#39;m glad that he took me seriously and offered helpful advice He&#39;s been a great member to have around the past year and a half. <img class="emoji " alt="blobReach" title="blobReach" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/625199321054445598.gif" /></span>

Like Carrot, he often left his attacks until the end of the day since he was flexible and could hit any boss, which made my life a lot easier when organizing attacks. Even more than that, though, he was a great asset because he&#39;d always have every team tested, I never had to worry about &quot;if he could hit&quot;, I just knew that he could, sorta like Rasp in that sense.

Since he joined in January, that meant he was in the clan for just about a year? I recall him being a hard worker in the beginning, testing teams and whatnot. As his motivation for the game waned, though, he tested less and less until in the end he admitted he was just gonna be a Kasumi that followed timelines we wrote up. Though unlike Kasumi, he had good game knowledge and could do respectable damage with just a timeline and a few practices so this wasn&#39;t an issue and we were still glad to have him around. 

Angela is probably most well known for leaking us chinese teams/spreadsheets, which were a big help when we first got to new tiers.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">Rispain I&#39;ll give a 5/10. Wait, no, that might not be fair to Cryst and Dennis who were actually good in the beginning. Wait, no, that&#39;s not fair to Risp, I&#39;m pretty sure did try, he just didn&#39;t have Chris. Ever. IIRC he never managed to roll her or save a spark for her. I think Risp&#39;s three biggest problems were: not having chris, english wasn&#39;t his native language and he didn&#39;t have that much time to play. He was prone to coming online close to the end of the day, not knowing what to do and not having tested anything. Sorta like Kasumi, I guess, except he wasn&#39;t able to &#39;clutch things out&#39; nearly as well... He was a nice guy though. And thinking about it now, his english wasn&#39;t <em>that</em> bad, he was still able to talk and joke in chat, I recall him having a good sense of humor. 

Actually, I do have a regret when it comes to Risp and it&#39;s, like... IIRC Eri was sorta vocal about his dislike of Risp in the end and in general Risp knew that he was on the weaker end of the spectrum so when he left, he basically sent me a DM apologizing for his poor performance and I <em>meant</em> to DM him back saying something like &quot;please don&#39;t worry about, we were still glad to have him&quot; etc etc but he sent me the message at a time when I was particularly depressed so I didn&#39;t respond for a while and then the next CB started and I forgot about it during CB and then it had been so long that I felt it might be awkward to respond &#39;out of the blue&#39; so I still never messaged him back and I feel really bad about that. He must think that I think he was so bad, he wasn&#39;t worth replying to. <img class="emoji " alt="PepeHands" title="PepeHands" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/590415904366526464.png" /> man, typing it now makes me feel even worse.

He was only in the clan for two months and both months he was below the &quot;average top 100 cutoff&quot; and IIRC he ended up leaving himself after the second month before we could actually kick him (and we were going to). I can&#39;t even remember why he was so bad. Roster? Not enough time to practice? I&#39;m not sure... He did last for two months though so I guess he was better than Sailor.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">Honnori gets a 7/10. Actually I was thinking 6.5 but I gave the other two 3 and 5, so 7 matches. Honnori&#39;s performance was pretty questionable in the beginning and looking at the spreadsheets, she was below the &quot;average top 100 cutoff&quot; the first two months but improved on the third. IIRC she was both new to CB and didn&#39;t have Chris in the beginning, which made things difficult.

Oh right, she was Cryst&#39;s IRL friend IIRC. That was actually the main reason that I didn&#39;t choose to kick her to make room for pine and co two months later. All in all, I don&#39;t regret not kicking her though since she eventually became a decently solid member - she didn&#39;t have <em>that</em> much time to play and almost always did her attacks near the end of the day but I don&#39;t recall ever having any issues, she was able to hit what I asked her to and whatnot. I think more than a few times she was alongside Carrot in the &quot;sacrificing attacks at the last minute&quot; squad? But she never complained about it, which was nice.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">Jon and SK I&#39;ve decided to write together since I think they both fall into the same rating of 9/10. Previously I&#39;d only given this to mods and Carrot but I think they both deserve it for the additions they brought to the clan - namely Kyaru Bot and SK&#39;s databases - and I believe that Clover wouldn&#39;t have grown and improved as well as we did without them.

Jon mentioned that Taki did way better hits than him but tbh I don&#39;t remember his hits being bad, I would&#39;ve said he pulled his weight just as well as the other three. Well, as I type that, I think I do recall Jon DMing me once and asking if &quot;being below the average top 100 cutoff meant he&#39;d be kicked&quot; but I recall being surprised then as well since I&#39;d never considered kicking him haha

Hmmmm, as for what else to say... I know I just said it but I think it&#39;s worth stressing again how grateful I am to them for sharing Kyaru Bot and the databases with Clover, they really were amazing. But beyond that, there&#39;s not much to say since they were just great members with no issues and their hatred of neko was pretty tame compared to Pine.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">Now as for Pine, I&#39;ll give him an 7.5/10. His CB performance was great, I&#39;m pretty sure he tested his own teams, his damage was always good, etc. I don&#39;t recall having any issues except for, well, his excessive hatred of neko. <img class="emoji " alt="vampyHeh" title="vampyHeh" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/625199320496472084.png" /> 

Looking back on it now, there were two main things that caused me a lot of stress and I believe I was unfairly attributing those things in particular to Pine&#39;s hatred of Neko:
A.) whether to create a new channel solely for CB discussion (since before cb-main was created, we only used the main lobby)
B.) whether we should share our teams and boss-channels with other people/clans (the more stressful of the two)

The &quot;attributing those things to Pine&#39;s hatred&quot; being because they happened at the same time as pine and co. joined the server and, as far as I recall anyway, Pine was the one pushing for the changes the most. Since I generally don&#39;t like change, I was hesitant to do both those things and I guess blamed my stress at the time on something like &quot;Pine just wanting these changes so Neko can&#39;t get our info&quot;, which I realize now is an unfair way of thinking about it since there were both other people that wanted &#39;em and other, actually valid reasons for &#39;em.</span>

I guess the TL;DR is that the addition of pine and co. to the clan was the start of a very stressful chain of events as Clover went through some significant changes. As I type that, I realize perhaps the biggest &#39;change&#39; (in terms of leadership for me) was that I started actually interacting with other clans and their leaders. Hmmm, an interesting thought.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">Also, you know, thinking back on it all now, in terms of the two points I listed above, it feels a little ironic (?) in a sense because the reason Pine was in Clover server in the first place was because he asked if he could join to see how things were run in a top clan - he wanted ideas to improve Sali, sorta thing. (And at the time, I naturally just gave him access to our boss channels as well since I didn&#39;t care to &#39;hide&#39; them.) 

And I mean, I can understand where he&#39;s coming from, of course: when he was on the outside looking in, he saw that we were &#39;giving away our info&#39; and thought that wasn&#39;t a good idea so when he joined, he pointed it out. But I admit, I can&#39;t help but laugh a little bit thinking of him getting the info and then joining and saying &quot;and now don&#39;t give it to anyone else pls&quot;. <img class="emoji " alt="animeHehe" title="animeHehe" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/427991811479568415.png" /></span>

                    <span class="markdown">While sitting here trying to decide on a meme rating for Melvi, I realized that I don&#39;t actually really know what his CB performance was like. Like, I know that I never had an issues with it but... It was around this time that I stopped seriously examining the spreadsheets (and there wasn&#39;t score rankings being kept for a while now) so I didn&#39;t really look at the ppl that were doing well - only taking note of the ppl below the &quot;average top 50 score&quot;. I know that he often stayed up late holding attacks... &quot;thankfully&quot; since he&#39;s EU that meant the middle of the day so it was only really an issue if he worked in the morning. Well, I&#39;m pretty sure his attacks were good...! <img class="emoji " alt="daishouri" title="daishouri" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/586322872780455955.png" />

Oh yeah, I still need to actually give him a rating. Let&#39;s go with 8.5/10. I&#39;d say that he always tried his best and... Oh yeah, he did test some stuff when we got to new rounds cuz I got DMs with damage results here and there. And another good thing is he kept track of all the team combinations he could do himself. Oh and he helped me optimize a fair amount of teams in voice chat while screen sharing - one example is that we were in call for around 6+ hours working on that Cloud Nyaru Wanpan haha

<span class="spoiler">Actually I was thinking of giving Melvi an 8/10 but he sends me lewds so I raised his rating a bit.</span></span>

                    <span class="markdown">Let&#39;s see... When Meow applied, I recall we were discussing him in the potential-recruits channel and some of his past &#39;drama&#39; was brought up which consequently had us primarily discussing reasons not to accept him. The stuff we were discussing eventually made it to Meow himself, since he had a friend in the clan, so Meow DM&#39;d me saying that he understood he hadn&#39;t done so well in the past but he was hoping for a second chance to prove himself, since he&#39;d been working hard since then to improve (and also he had intel on Chinese clans to offer). We had a pretty length chat after that and in the end I decided it was worth giving him the shot.

As for his actual CB performance, he did work pretty hard tbh. I&#39;m fairly certain he didn&#39;t have any issues, like, piloting teams so that combined with taking overflows and re-rolling attacks meant he ended that month with the highest raw damage done. I think he was able to share some teams that Chinese clans were using? And I don&#39;t recall anyone having any issues with him during CB - like he communicated effectively, made sure to pause, etc with no issues. 

I think overall I&#39;d say that he was very good during CB and outside of CB, he&#39;s like maybe a little annoying at worst. The only real issue I recall having with him was that he only stayed for one CB and then his reason for leaving was IIRC cuz he was gonna be busy with school after that but I&#39;m fairly certain he just joined a top 50 Chinese clan after that anyway so his &#39;reason&#39; seemed pretty suspect to me and I never understood that. I remember being all ready to defend him from all those awful rumors and be like &quot;no, he&#39;s a really hard worker, he did really well last CB!&quot; but then he left and I was like oh okay nvm then, c ya. 

Oh and he&#39;s actually pretty good at drawing tbh. He sent me a cute &#39;praying&#39; Misato image which he was wondering if it&#39;d make a good emote but it didn&#39;t really work out cuz the hands were awkward to fit into the small emote size.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">Aru gets a 7.5/10. I think I&#39;m gonna write this stuff out in point-form notes cuz I can&#39;t think of a good way to make them flow. <img class="emoji " alt="animePeek1" title="animePeek1" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/427991811936747520.png" /> 

 ※ TBH, when it comes to Aru, I feel like I didn&#39;t understand what he was thinking / where he was coming from half the time and that isn&#39;t even taking the language barrier into consideration... One conversation I recall having was after Peco/Kyaru/Kokkoro 6-stars were released - I&#39;d made a comment during the CB after that basically bashing those that didn&#39;t have the 6-stars ready for CB (and if I didn&#39;t say it directly at Aru, it was pretty obvious it was at him since IIRC he was the only one without Kokkoro). Anyway, we talked in DMs a bit after that CB and I apologized for my comment and during the conversation, he said:
<div class="quote">its hard to trust someone mad at you. right? &quot;mistrust?&quot;.</div><div class="quote">you dont like the boss who hate you because of stupid thing.</div>And I had to clarify that being &#39;mad&#39; and &#39;hating&#39; someone are very different and that I didn&#39;t hate him at all. It also took me by surprise, how he&#39;d jumped straight to the conclusion that I must hate him... <img class="emoji " alt="sweat1" title="sweat1" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/625199320483889163.png" /> 

 ※ When Aru applied for the clan, he said that he was Japanese but:
<div class="quote">I have interested your clan because: Maybe I was just ignorance but I didnt know there is English SS-rakned clan like you, and I am curious how you managed that.</div><div class="quote">... and using english during c.b. is .. sounds fun to me. idk. </div>And I recall we discussed in the recruitment channel that maybe he was a JP spy or perhaps just a reverse-weeb. <img class="emoji " alt="animeHehe" title="animeHehe" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/427991811479568415.png" /></span>

                    <span class="markdown">※ Aru had a habit of hoarding resources, most notably mana and dupe stones. Does anyone recall how many dupe stones he got up to near the end? It was at least 5k, right? Or 7k? Anyway, the running joke was that he&#39;d never upgrade any character unless completely absolutely necessary. I recall during the last month he was here he made a comment about &quot;3-star P.Peco not working&quot;, to put it into perspective. But... looking back at it now, he was way ahead of the curve in terms of avoiding p2l, eh? How the tables have turned.

 ※ I was going to give him a lower rating because of his incredible amount of sass and complaining during his last two (?) months but decided that, ignoring that, most of the time he did offer legitimate criticism and just wanted Clover to be a better clan. And his performance was pretty good in the beginning, it was just sorta in that last month where he threw some attacks... Hmmm but this has me comparing with Cryst again LOL Cryst never threw any hits the way Aru did yet I gave him a 5.5... Maybe Cryst should be a 6 and Aru a 7. This is difficult. <img class="emoji " alt="kaosDeadUgh" title="kaosDeadUgh" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/625199320559255571.png" /></span>

                    <span class="markdown">Chie I give 9/10. The reason for this is the same as Carrot, really - he helped organize attacks at the end of the day sometimes (he started picking up the slack when I took that two month break IIRC) and helping with mod duties = a 9. <img class="emoji " alt="daishouri" title="daishouri" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/586322872780455955.png" /> 

As for his CB performance... He&#39;s sorta in the same boat as Melvi where I stopped paying as much attention and so, since I don&#39;t recall him having any issues, I don&#39;t have much to say... <img class="emoji " alt="pepeMonkaHmmm" title="pepeMonkaHmmm" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/625199320047812630.png" /> But if he organized attacks that means he had to have a detailed knowledge of all the teams members could use (I assume) which is, like, already &#39;above and beyond&#39; in terms of what was expected, sorta thing, so I&#39;m sure he worked hard. Well, like I mentioned before, I&#39;m sorta running out of original things to say about people but he was a strong, consistent member and one I&#39;m glad to have had around. <img class="emoji " alt="animeNodYes" title="animeNodYes" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/427991826872401933.gif" /> 

Chie and I didn&#39;t really talk outside of CB so I don&#39;t know much about him and don&#39;t have anything interesting to say but he&#39;s another member that helped with JP translation which I am very grateful for. <img class="emoji " alt="blobaww" title="blobaww" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/316325032194473984.png" /></span>

                    <span class="markdown">Fun Fact: I did most of the recruitment process with OhJay (ie. asking him the usual preliminary questions when he applied) on my phone while sitting in a Tim Hortons. I don&#39;t know why I remember that so vividly but I do.

OhJay I give an 8.5/10. He was so new when he joined but look at how much he&#39;s grown. <img class="emoji " alt="blobaww" title="blobaww" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/316325032194473984.png" /> Honestly I don&#39;t remember exactly how bad his account was when he applied... All I know is that we only just barely accepted him because we didn&#39;t have any other options, we (I) didn&#39;t want to pilot again and he looked like he had potential, at the very least. For example, his Hard-farmable characters (Shinobu, Kokkoro, Peco, etc) were lacking but I recall him having all the limiteds that had been released since he started playing, with most of them being 5-star. 

Looking at the spreadsheets, his first CB score was, well, pretty bad tbh but by his third CB (Oct), he was already near the top of the charts lol and I&#39;m pretty sure his performance continued to be top-tier since then because I don&#39;t recall ever having any issues. Overall I&#39;d say Jay did more than his share of team testing and was a great asset to have around, I&#39;m definitely glad we gave him a chance that month and picked him up. And I guess, by extension, glad that he applied in the first place!</span>

Ah, this appears to be the month that Troupe started taking over for recruitment... and me not being in charge of the applicants means I&#39;m going to have a lot less things to say about members starting now... <img class="emoji " alt="sweat1" title="sweat1" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/625199320483889163.png" /> Well I looked at our DMs to see if Yolo applied through me or not and found out that he applied back in June but changed his mind when I mentioned our Queue system. I&#39;m not sure if he somehow learned we sorta stopped using the bot as a real &quot;Queue&quot; or if that just sorta worked out when he applied again but regardless I&#39;m glad it worked out, he was a good, hard-working member to have around.

Fun Fact: He (accidentally) sent me a Discord friend request before he first messaged me and I declined it almost immediately because I assumed it had to be a troll, based on the name... <img class="emoji " alt="sweat1" title="sweat1" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/625199320483889163.png" /> And between Nobody, Will and Yolo, I think Yolo&#39;s name was the most &#39;annoying&#39; of the bunch aka. it &#39;got in the way&#39; the most during CB when I was trying to use the actual word itself and not his name... <img class="emoji " alt="clarise" title="clarise" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/352451406671642625.png" /></span>

A.) His damage looks to have always been pretty good, he was Rank #3 the first month he joined and ended Rank #2 last month.
B.) He was very good at optimizing teams - the main example being the one I mentioned before of how he optimized the B1 Maho team even further than I did.

And, yeah... Fuck, man, these last few ratings are gonna be so lame... He was a good member and I rate his team optimizing very highly... I don&#39;t know what else to say, I&#39;m sorry.

                    <span class="markdown">Kayla I&#39;ll give a 6/10. The reasons for this being that:
A.) their damage Rank was pretty low in the last three months I was here
B.) there was a few times they asked if someone could do hits for them
C.) they often asked for help deciding what three teams they should use, sometimes disturbingly close to the end of the day

Actually, as I typed that, I realized that point A was probably caused by point C - an unfortunate case of the Kasumi but with not being able to pull through as effectively added onto often losing damage in the last-minute rushes.

Now the assumption is that they were busy IRL and didn&#39;t have much time to play which is understandable but unfortunately the results were that there damage was lower than average and needing to be piloted was a burden on others.

As I sit here waiting for Hibiki to finish so I don&#39;t interrupt, I ponder again: Did I rate Cryst too low or Kayla too high...? <img class="emoji " alt="pepeMonkaHmmm" title="pepeMonkaHmmm" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/625199320047812630.png" /></span>

                    <span class="markdown">I give Megu a 7.5. This is for two reasons:
A.) I combined the 6 meme ratings discussed yesterday and that was the average.
B.) I&#39;ll give her a lower rating to counter her statement that my average ratings had gone up over time. <img class="emoji " alt="kappa" title="kappa" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/625199319678451713.png" /> 

Hmmm, well, I have a lot of respect for Megu - the main reasons being because of her skills as a clan leader (how far she was able to take/push/carry PDK) and her ability to optimize teams. I respect her for her CB performance as well but I realize while typing this that I guess I took that for granted, or rather, expected it haha looking at it now, she was actually Rank 1 in damage in December. <s>Did she just not have a life during christmas break?</s> jk jk <img class="emoji " alt="clarise" title="clarise" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/352451406671642625.png" /> 

Beyond that, I&#39;m not too sure what to say that isn&#39;t the usual compliments for members with good CB performance... We haven&#39;t talked that much in DMs outside of team optimizing which, when combined with how I used to take our conversations very seriously (I wasn&#39;t used to talking with other clan leaders, ya know), means I can&#39;t think of anything interesting to say. At the very least, as a fellow lover of Chloe&#39;s thighs, I respect her judgement.</span>

Overall his CB performance was solid, I don&#39;t recall having any complaints - his damage, communication and team testing was good. I recall the teams he uploaded to his YouTube channel being easy to use but still decent damage, nice for when we were running out of time at the end of the day. Other than that, I&#39;m not sure what else I can comment on since we&#39;ve not really talked outside of CB... At the very least, I believe he&#39;s very passionate about the game, taking everything from the big things like PvP to the small things like item donations seriously.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">Dymond gets a 7/10 because while overall I think he did pretty well, it seemed like his time to play each day was limited and his damage was a little low as a result (presumably both from not having as much time to test teams and also IIRC he lost damage in last-minute rushes). Although as I typed that, I remembered that he was losing motivation and wanted to leave after Feb CB but said he didn&#39;t mind staying if we couldn&#39;t find a replacement (and naturally we couldn&#39;t) so that was very kind of him and now I can&#39;t decide if he should be a 7.5 instead.

I just discussed it briefly with Megu for a refresher and while he was piloted twice, once by each of us, both times he had legitimate reasons so that wasn&#39;t an issue. In fact, the day that I piloted for him, it was on his account that I was able to do the 8mil B1 hit which won me some money in Tatsuki&#39;s competition. Totally worth! <img class="emoji " alt="Poggies" title="Poggies" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/681310296010391711.png" /> We haven&#39;t talked much so not sure what else to say but he seems like a nice guy.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">Ynfy gets a 6.5/10 from me. His performance was decent, if not on the lower end. He did have a few unfortunate fails though, missing pauses or making mistakes in a fight (or getting screwed by rng, can&#39;t remember which tbh) when there was nobody around to save him, which led to bosses being left at awkward hp levels which stalled our progress for a few hours. He also had playtime issues, working like 12 hours a day which naturally left him with not much time to play our &#39;style&#39; of CB.

He did end up leaving after December because of his lack of time, and being discouraged by seeing complaints about how that CB went in this channel. I feel like most of the things that went wrong weren&#39;t his fault but he felt responsible for them anyway, so it was a regrettable end.</span>

Put bluntly, I had him pegged as someone that I should have a backup plan for in case he failed his attack when I was organizing attacks at the end of the day. With that said, I was pleasantly surprised the following two months when he had very few issues and effectively pulled off the teams I had him marked down for and my opinion of him reverted back to a positive light. I believe the main issue he had was forgetting to pause but IIRC it somehow always worked out and there weren&#39;t any real issues. <img class="emoji " alt="lul" title="lul" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/625199320592941073.png" /> Otherwise, unfortunately, I don&#39;t have anything interesting to say cuz we didn&#39;t talk outside of CB...

                    <span class="markdown">&quot;Mura is a decent guy, he does a lot for Symphony&quot; - Megu
I agree. I give him a perfect 5/7.

I&#39;ll be honest, I judged Nobody by his name and was very skeptical when he joined. Don&#39;t ask, I don&#39;t know why. Anyway, I&#39;m glad that was unfounded and he turned out to be a great member. I don&#39;t recall any issues with his performance and he seemed like a cool guy. 7.5/10, probably could&#39;a been higher if, you know, we&#39;d had more than two months of CB together and I got to know him better before the clan <img class="emoji " alt="💥" title="💥" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f4a5.png" /> 

Towa gets an 8.5/10 for being a solid member and a good addition to the clan - akin to Nobody but with an extra point for A.) contributing multiple posts in the timeline channels and B.) piloting a second account to fill a spot in the clan. Very grateful for all your hard work, thank you. 

Sailor gets a <img class="emoji " alt="⛵" title="⛵" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/26f5.png" /> / 10. I think that, uh, we sorta discussed him enough when CB ended that I don&#39;t need to go over it again here, right? Actually, wait, Chie already rated the new guys from the last month (Sailor + the JP guys), do I even need to do it again?! Oh also I forgot to thank Megu for the piloting she did for Sailor (and Dymond) so thanks for that. <img class="emoji " alt="clarise" title="clarise" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/352451406671642625.png" /> 

I swear I already rated mimori&#39;s picture of his balcony but I can&#39;t find it anymore. It was something like a 7/10, looked great but was a little too blurry. 

Yuki I give a 7.5/10 because chie gave him an 8 but I am knocking off half a point because he didn&#39;t have an original name.</span>
